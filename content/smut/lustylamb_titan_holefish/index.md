His hyper erection reaches up to his chin and spears two Titan Holefish from Subnautica, with huge shots of cum floating in the water in front of him.  Both fish are blushing, and the lower of the two has a tiny erection."

[Lamb](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/lustylamb) had a silly idea on her "Ideas I'd love to draw" list, and I had an extra hour slot to fill.<!-- more --> I think it came out fantastically!  This is the first really hyper depiction of my taur form, which I love~  And it's also wonderfully ridiculous :3

From [the Subnautica Wiki](https://subnautica.fandom.com/wiki/Titan_Holefish): "The hole is partially filled with a transparent light-blue gel[...]."  So they're pre-lubed!
