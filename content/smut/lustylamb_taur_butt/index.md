His gigantic, knotted canine cock is sticking out behind him and laying on the ground, spraying cum.  It is only slightly smaller than his taur torso.  His balls are as big as his knot, and he also has a large, puffy, puckered anus.  He has tucked a hook on a leash into it to stretch it open."

Another fantastic commission from [LustyLamb](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/lustylamb)! This time even more hyper than [the last one](/smut/lustylamb_titan_holefish/) :P<!--more-->

I saw she was taking quick sale commissions last weekend, and listed taurs and hyper as preferred topics! I didn't have any hyper butthole art, so I took the opportunity to fix that~  I gave Lamb artistic freedom, as long as the result had huge junk, and she absolutely nailed it!  The silver thing in my ass is a hook, to stretch it openâ€”but it's just as much fun to think of it as a piercing!  I might keep that detail for future commissions :3
