My first for-real ref sheet!  I had a color-your-own ref sheet before this one, but Silver Edge did a way better job :P

The slash on my back has three layers of meaning, which is pretty good for a joke my boyfriend came up with at 3 am:

1. The obvious groan-worthy pun: a _back_ slash.
1. A backslash is a character, and I enjoy typography.
1. Backslashes are frequently used in programming languages as an escape character, to write things that are otherwise not representable, and I'm a computer scientist.
