The background of the image is the demisexual pride flag, rotated 135ยบ clockwise (so that the black triangle is between the wolf's ears)"

This is an alternate Pride month version of [the excellent icon commission Cyrisus did for me in 2022](/gallery/cyrisusl_icon_2022/).  I usually just slap a ring around the image with the demi flag masked in, but this version looks way better!
