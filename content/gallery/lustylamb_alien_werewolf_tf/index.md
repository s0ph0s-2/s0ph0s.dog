He's ripping out of his purple T-shirt and tan cargo pants as his maw splits and two more eyes open. Also, his purple nail polish is cracking off as his claws grow."

A spooky Halloween-themed YCH by [LustyLamb](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/lustylamb)!<!--more--> I saw that Lamb put up some YCH commissions to help cover the cost of recovering from hurricane Ian, and this werewolf TF piece fit perfectly :3  She did an amazing job of showing what it looks like when the moon comes out and I start to change into a big, hulking were-beast.  A shame about my outfit though, those were my favorite pants!
