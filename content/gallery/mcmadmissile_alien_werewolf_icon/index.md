[McMadMissile](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/mcmadmissile/) brought to life an idea I've had knocking around for *years*.<!--more--> When I first watched [Ben 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_10) as a kid, I thought "damn, [that werewolf's](https://ben10.fandom.com/wiki/Blitzwolfer) split muzzle thing is super cool looking."  The image stuck with me for over a decade, and I constantly kept watch on furry art sites for more depictions of that alien from the show.  Unfortunately, very few other people thought it was as cool as I didâ€”of the 43 posts currently on e621 tagged with `loboan`, exactly 3 of them show the quadra-hinged maw, and they're all from the same comic series :(

Last winter, that desire for more quadra-hinged maw art coalesced into a realization: there are no fursona police, if I want to turn into a cool alien wolf-beast with a quadra-hinged maw on the full moon, I can!  And McMadMissile made it happen!  This piece is just the start, I'm going to be getting a bunch more art of this form :3

I particularly love the saliva tinted green by the backlight, and the way that the eyes glow gold~  They really up the creepy factor!
